# Performing a kmers-based GWAS for potato circadian rhythms
Based on analysis using the pipeline suggested in Voichek & Weigel (2020)  
The general workflow for generating kmer counts and compiling them into a kmer table for this dataset can be found in `manual_commands.md`, which closely resembles the manual for kmersGWAS located here: https://github.com/voichek/kmersGWAS/blob/master/manual.pdf. Code for generating plots can be found in `kmersGWAS_utils.ipynb`.
